# Developing a likelihood-based approach to detect mutagenic recombination
This repo contains scripts to infer whether the process of recombination is mutagnenic.
Manuscript (Detecting mutagenic recombination using genome-wide divergence data) in preparation (Phung et al.)
I presented this project at ASHG 2016. Abstract can be found at: http://www.ashg.org/2016meeting/pdf/ASHG2016-posterabstracts.pdf (Poster 1166T).
